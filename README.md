## A responsive Portfolio showcasing my works.

During the creation of my portfolio I was able to gain a better understanding of how CSS styles a page; I used hover to create transition and blur effects, how certain properties affect other items on the page, and many other advanced CSS skills.<br><br>
Through this project I have grown my understanding of how code behaves and interacts on a webpage and within the files. I will continue to learn and apply lessons from class to the Portfolio as the Bootcamp at DU continues.
