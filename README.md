## A responsive Portfolio showcasing my works.

During the creation of my portfolio I was able to gain a better understanding of how CSS styles a page; I used hover to create transition and blur effects, how certain properties affect other items on the page, and many other advanced CSS skills.<br><br>
Through this project I have grown my understanding of how code behaves and interacts on a webpage and within the files. I will continue to learn and apply lessons from class to the Portfolio as the Bootcamp at DU continues.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

The code throughout each page needs to be refracted and some lines of code need to be removed. Will address at a later time.
