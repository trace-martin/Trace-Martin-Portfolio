## A responsive Portfolio showcasing my works.

During the creation of my portfolio I was able to gain a better understanding of how CSS styles a page; I used hover to create transition and blur effects, how certain properties affect other items on the page, and many other advanced CSS skills.<br><br>
Through this project I have grown my understanding of how code behaves and interacts on a webpage and within the files. I will continue to learn and apply lessons from class to the Portfolio as the Bootcamp at DU continues.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## User Instructions

To navigate the page use the nav bar at the top right section of the screen. Each nav link will take you to the corresponding page to view the information relating to the title.<br> 
<br>

### Known Issues
<hr>
The code throughout each page needs to be refracted and some lines of code need to be removed. Will address at a later time.
